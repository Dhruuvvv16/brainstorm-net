# Neural Network from Scratch 🧠

This project implements a basic feedforward neural network from scratch using NumPy.

## 🔧 Current Features

- Fully connected neural network
- Manual forward and backward propagation
- Training via stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
- Supports classification tasks (e.g., binary/multi-class)

## ⚠️ Limitations (Work in Progress)

- ❌ **Mini-batch gradient descent** not yet implemented
- ❌ **Model does not perform well on continuous/regression tasks**

> For example, on the **diabetes dataset**, the current model achieves an **R² score of ~0.46**, which indicates poor regression performance.

## 📌 To Do

- [ ] Add mini-batch gradient descent
- [ ] Improve regression performance
